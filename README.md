# Milestone project 1 
## Build a website for a Hair salon

There are many hair salons out there that providing the service and a good clean website can make a big difference. 
Most of the people care about how they look and sometimes picky about who is touching their hairs, and if they find 
a good hair salon that can feel comfortable and get satisfactory hair service they stick to it for a lifetime. 
  
The aim of this website is to bring a nice online presentation of the type of services that the hair salon can provide. 
And making people feel comfortable being a member of this hair salon. This will be obviously good for the owner and hair salon team members 
which can increase the number of customers and be competitive in the market.

## UX

This website is going to be for a hair salon business owner who would like to increase their popularity. 
The owner was in this business for a while now and they have their regular customers, 
but they have realized that the number of their new customers is decreasing over the years. 
So, they are thinking having a website can help them attract new customers.

The aim of this project is to provide a good online presentation which can lead to having more new customers. 
The webpage is going to present the hair salon as a professional environment. 
It is going to give a good overview of the type of services that hair salon can provide. 
It will present the hair salon team which can induce a friendly feeling to new customers. 
It will provide good contact information and how to get to the place.

* People would like to feel that can get professional service in a hairsalon.
* My partner, she is a saying, she wants to see how the hairdresser looks like. 
  This can be achieved with a good presentation of the team.
* As a new customer, I would like to see the previous results of their work. 
  This can be achieved with an image gallery or reviews from the regular customers
