# Milestone project 1 
## Build a website for a [Hair salon](https://majpaji.github.io/Milestone-Project-1/)

There are many hair salons out there that providing the service and a good clean website can make a big difference. 
Most of the people care about how they look and sometimes picky about who is touching their hairs, and if they find 
a good hair salon that they can feel comfortable and get satisfactory hair service they stick to it for a lifetime. 
  
This website aims to bring a nice online presentation of the type of services that the hair salon can provide. 
And making people feel comfortable being a member of this hair salon. This will be obviously good for the owner and hair 
salon team members which can increase the number of customers and be competitive in the market.

## UX

This website is going to be for a hair salon business owner who would like to increase their popularity. 
The owner was in this business for a while now and they have their regular customers, 
but they have realized that the number of their new customers is decreasing over the years. 
So, they are thinking having a website can help them attract new customers.

This project aims to provide a good online presentation which can lead to having more new customers. 
The webpage is going to present the hair salon as a professional environment. It is going to give a good overview of the type of services that hair salon can provide. 
It will present the hair salon team which can induce a friendly feeling to new customers. It will provide good contact information and how to get to the place.

* People would like to feel that can get professional service in a hairsalon.
* My partner, she is a saying, she wants to see how the hairdresser looks like. 
  This can be achieved with a good presentation of the team.
* As a new customer, I would like to see the previous results of their work. 
  This can be achieved with an image gallery or reviews from the regular customers.

- Home page [(index.html)](https://github.com/MajPaji/Milestone-Project-1/blob/master/testing/home.pdf)
- Service pages:
    - Style your hair page [(style-your-hair.html)](https://github.com/MajPaji/Milestone-Project-1/blob/master/testing/services_style_your_hair.pdf)
    - color your hair page [(color-your-hair.html)](https://github.com/MajPaji/Milestone-Project-1/blob/master/testing/services_color_your_hair.pdf)

The website validated with Markup Validation Service W3C® without any major problem. 
There was some issue with having “%” size for img attribute in HTML and the commenting format in HTML which were resolved. 
There was no problem regarding CSS validation.

The main aim of this project was to present the hair salon as a professional work environment. 
This was tried to achieve with giving a full-size background image that shows skillful hairdresser hands 
in the home page and a callout message “We are engaged to our profession” which indicate the commitment of 
the hair salon to their work and in the image, the hand has an engagement ring to give 
the similar idea as it is shown in the following picture:

Also, one of the aims was to encourage new customers. 
This was tried to achieve with giving a 20% discount for the first visit of the hair salon in the [home page](https://majpaji.github.io/Milestone-Project-1/index.html).

The introduction of the different services was presented in summary with self-explanatory icons on the [home page](https://majpaji.github.io/Milestone-Project-1/index.html) which can link to separate pages. 
In the individual service pages, services were introduced with a paragraph and pictures for the [style](https://majpaji.github.io/Milestone-Project-1/style-your-hair.html), 
[color](https://majpaji.github.io/Milestone-Project-1/color-your-hair.html) and [treat](https://majpaji.github.io/Milestone-Project-1/treat-your-hair.html) your hair, respectively.

In the [team](https://majpaji.github.io/Milestone-Project-1/team.html) webpage section, it was tried to introduce hair salon teammate characters in the way which can give friendly feeling to the visitors 
to see how they look like and the other languages that they could speak (required from the UX story). 
Also, adding some explanations about their skills and quotes from each one.

The [gallery](https://majpaji.github.io/Milestone-Project-1/gallery.html) webpage provided a few examples of the previous works of the hair salon (required from the UX story).

The [contact us](https://majpaji.github.io/Milestone-Project-1/contact-us.html) webpage provides a form area in which people can give their comments and remarks.
